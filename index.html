    <p>I have been dabbling in web development and this is my first attempt at creating a webpage on my own. Nothing complicated. Just testing my knowledge and adding pictures of my cat.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h3>My Beginning</h3>
    <p>A long time ago, I wanted to be a vet. I went to school to earn my degree in Animal Sciences. However, partway through I decided not to go to vet school. Not willing to change degrees, I graduated with this degree and went in search of new career paths. I started in pharma, and eventually found my self as a Project Manager for technology vendors in the clinical research world.</p>

    <h3>Why am I learning web development?</h3>
    <p>While Project Management can be a financially rewarding career it is not for everyone. The concept is simiple: Organized common sense to keep a project moving forward using good communication skills and making sure eveyone is on the same page. The execution is much different though. It can be thank-less, frustrating, and stressfull. A thick-skinned person can manage, but for most the burnout is inevitable.</p>

    <p>So what do you do when it becomes too much? Find a new career! I switched project manager jobs to a new, healthy company, and I know that one day I'll be tired and exhausted of that, too. Right I'm going to use my time before the stress has built up to learn how to do web development. The great thing about web development is there are resources everywhere to learn it. I also get to learn and create new things, appealing to my creative side.

    <h3>So what about this cat?</h3>
    <p>I have a cat, and his name is Titan! Since this is my first attempt at a webpage, he will be included frequently because I have many pictures of him to use at my disposal</p>

    <h3>More about Titan</h3>
    <p>Titan is chubby tabby cat. He was rescued by a friend while she was on vacation from the clutches of a very dumb person and rough dog. She could not keep him, so I took him in. He was small, and underweight from being outside, at only 6 weeks of age. He also had fleas so baths with blue Dawn dish soap were a regular thing. He has been buddy-cat and sidekick ever since.</p>

    <h3>Does Titan have nicknames?</h3>
    <p>Yes! He has many! Below is a list of the many he has.
      <ul>
        <li>Titanocat</li>
        <li>T-Cat</li>
        <li>Mr. T</li>
        <li>Tubs</li>
        <li>The Fatness</li>
        <li>Beast</li>
      </ul>
